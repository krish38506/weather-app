# weather-project
I developed a web application that provides weather information for any city using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a weather API. The application allows users to enter a city name and retrieve real-time weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

The frontend is built with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. The interface is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, ensuring accessibility on both desktop and mobile devices.

JavaScript handles the API requests, fetching weather data from a reliable source like the OpenWeatherMap API. Upon receiving the data, it dynamically updates the webpage to display the relevant weather information. Error handling is implemented to provide feedback for invalid city names or API issues.

The project demonstrates effective integration of third-party APIs with core web development technologies to deliver useful and timely information. This approach not only enhances the user experience but also showcases the practical application of web technologies in real-world scenarios. The project is an example of how simple yet powerful tools can create an informative and interactive web application.
